          </h1>
          <p>We are pushing for positive change in the sustainable palm oil industry by developing innovative solutions and by sharing best practices with our peers. To achieve real transformation on the ground, we must look beyond our own supply chains and work together with all stakeholders across the palm oil sector to tackle issues that impact both our industry and the global landscape at large.</p>
          <p>Our main stakeholder collaborations and partnerships are outlined below.</p>
          <ul class="iconcircle">
              <li><h3>Consortium of Resource Experts (CORE)</h3><p>CORE brings together two leading organizations dedicated to ensuring sustainable commodity production and sourcing: Proforest and Daemeter Consulting. This offers a comprehensive range of services, including risk analysis, policy development, traceability, capacity building, and third-party evaluation; as well as staff with unrivaled levels of technical and practical expertise at all levels of the supply chain.

                </p>
            <p>Since 2015, Musim Mas has been working with CORE to meet our commitments on sourcing sustainable palm oil. We have engaged in environmental risk assessments on a landscape-level, implementation of intervention programs for smallholders and suppliers, as well as the overall implementation of our Sustainability Policy.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Decent Rural Living Initiative</h3>
                    <p>The Decent Rural Living Initiative (DRLI) aims to improve the protection of human and labor rights in agriculture. The initiative aims to produce practical and realistic recommendations to help rural workers associated with the agricultural sector secure their long-term ability to thrive. Together with Cargill, Golden Agri-Resources, Sime Darby Plantation, and Wilmar International, we are piloting two pre-competitive solutions to address systemic labor rights challenges in Indonesia’s palm oil industry: (i) contract innovations to improve labor conditions of casual workers, and (ii) enhancing gender committees’ role on estates.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Fire Free Alliance</h3>
                    <p>Musim Mas joined a group of leading forestry and agriculture companies, NGOs, and other partners as founders of the Fire Free Alliance (FFA) in 2016. FFA activities support the Indonesian Government’s commitment to a haze-free ASEAN region by 2020. All FFA members share knowledge, data and, where possible, resources to roll out fire prevention initiatives based on APRIL Group’s Fire Free Village Programme (FFVP). All company members have implemented the FFVP as a means to engage local communities in protecting forests from fire. Learn more about the FFA at http://www.firefreealliance.org/</p>

                    <h3>High Carbon Stock (HCS) Approach Steering Group</h3>
                    <p>The Steering Group provides overall governance of the current HCS Approach and oversees the further development of a methodology designed to achieve no deforestation including refining its definition, its objectives and its relationship to other approaches to halting deforestation. Musim Mas has been a member of the Steering Group since 2015, and a member of its Executive Committee (HCSA decision-making body). We are also a member of several Working Groups, including the Social Requirements, High Forest Cover Landscapes, and Protection. Learn more about the HCS Approach at http://highcarbonstock.org/.</p>

                    <h3>Indonesia Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO)</h3>
                    <p>The Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) is a policy adopted by the Ministry of Agriculture on behalf of the Indonesian Government. It aims to improve the competitiveness of the Indonesian palm oil in the global market through regulation and certification for sustainable palm oil production. We are leading the ISPO’s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Working Group and have formulated the calculation guidelines for plantations in Indonesia together with the ISPO Commission. Learn more about the ISPO at http://www.ispo-org.or.id/index.php?lang=en.</p>

                    <p>Musim Mas is the sole Indonesia-based partner with International Finance Corporation (IFC) working on this program. Since 2015, we have been assisting independent smallholders in our operations in North Sumatra and Riau, through financial support and capacity building programs on efficient farming practices.</p>

Musim Mas has been a member since 2015 and has participated actively in the POIG Organising Committee (POIG’s decision-making body), Verification Working Group, Retailers & Manufacturers Working Group, and led the development of the POIG Traders & Processors Charter. We are currently chairing the Traders & Processors Working Group, as well as Communications Working Group. Learn more about POIG at http://poig.org/.</p>

            <img src="./img/Indonesia_Riau-650x260.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Riau is one of our top supplier provinces. We estimate that our supplier mills make up 70–80% of the total mills in the province, forming 23% of our total crude palm oil (CPO) procurement.</p>
            <p>Riau is the largest provincial contributor to the national production of palm oil and is the fifth-largest contributor towards Indonesia’s gross domestic product (GDP). Deforestation in the landscape has been severe. It has been estimated that illegal oil palm plantations have taken over at least 40% of the Tesso Nilo National Park. Another critical protected area is the Giam Siak Kecil peatlands, of which a significant portion is dominated by the pulp and paper sector. Riau is prone to forest fires during the annual dry season.</p>
            <p>Read our diagnostic report for Riau here.</p>
            <h4>Smallholder programs</h4>
            <p>As part of our independent smallholder program with IFC (International Finance Corporation), a member of the World Bank, we engaged smallholders supplying to our mills located in Riau. These mills are PT SAR (Sinar Agro Raya), PT BANI (Bahana Nusa Interindo), and PT ISB (Indomakmur Sawit Berjaya). More on this program here.</p>
            <p>Musim Mas is working with UNDP (United Nations Development Programme) to engage villages in Riau to establish smallholder programs.</p>
            <h4>External collaborations</h4>
            <p>Musim Mas is a member of the Tesso Nilo Taskforce since 2016. We are working with WWF Indonesia and Tesso Nilo National Park Foundation to mitigate human-elephant conflict around Tesso Nilo national park.</p>
            <p>We are also part of WWF Halt program, which helps supply chain stakeholders to register and digitally track FFB from plantation to mill. This traceability program would enable buyers (mills and traders) to identify and assess the legality of where the FFB originated, starting with a pilot around Tesso Nilo National Park.</p>
            <p>We are collaborating with an industry peer on a bottom-up, participatory landscape-level project to understand and map HCV-HCS areas, as well as existing and potential plots for smallholder expansion. We have finalized Siak district and PT. Teguh Karsa Wana Lestari (TKWL) as our mill for engagement, and have conducted in-depth analysis, training to build awareness with the mill staff, and assessments on the ground to identify potential HCS areas.</p>
            <p>Additionally, we are involved in a private-sector coalition, called the Siak-Pelalawan Landscape Program, which aims to support the government’s Siak Green District Initiative in its efforts to achieve sustainable palm oil production and align the delivery of sourcing commitments with the development goals of the district. These goals include protecting and enhancing forests, improving the livelihoods of smallholders and local communities, and establishing traceability data. Stakeholders involved include Cargill, Neste, PepsiCo, Golden AgriResources, Unilever, CORE, Sustainable District Platform (LTKL), Siak regent (local government).</p>
            <p>To improve the deforestation monitoring and verification system, we invested in the development of a new, publicly available radar-based forest monitoring system known as Radar Alerts for Detecting Deforestation (RADD). Siak-Pelalawan would be one of its pilot areas and it will be integrated into our landscape programs.</p>
