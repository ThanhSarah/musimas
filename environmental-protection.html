          <p>As a major player in the palm oil sector, we have a significant role in promoting sustainable forest management in our industry. We also play a part in contributing to the protection of critical ecosystems and biodiversity in and around the landscapes where we operate. We are deeply committed to environmental stewardship, and continuously strive to minimize and mitigate the impact of our operations. We enhance the state of the natural environment where possible and to identify areas where we can make a difference.</p>
          <h2>Our Principles</h2>
          <ul class="iconcircle">
              <li><p>Adherence to the Best Practices Guidelines laid down by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).</p></li>
              <li><p>No usage of fire during new development or replanting; preference to adopt mechanical methods.</p></li>
              <li><p>No development on Primary Forest or areas that are identified with High Conservation Values or High Carbon Stock (HCS).</p></li>
              <li><p>No development of HCS forests as defined by the HCS Approach.</p></li>
              <li><p>No development of Peatland, regardless of depth.</p></li>
              <li><p>No planting on steep terrain and/or marginal and fragile soils.</p></li>
              <li><p>No establishment of new plantings in places where it can be demonstrated that there are legal or customary or user rights, without having obtained ‘Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC)’.</p></li>
              <li><p>Continually explore ways to enhance the state of the natural environment in which we operate, by monitoring and continuously reviewing our activities.</p></li>

            <p>The Aceh Province contributes 5-10% of our total supply base. 87% of the Aceh-Leuser Ecosystem lies in the Aceh province. Even though Aceh is not a major producer of palm oil and has lower deforestation rates relative to other provinces, yet to the vocal critics of the industry, it is seen as being threatened by the expansion of agriculture, including oil palm.</p>
            <p>We have established initiatives in Aceh to address the risk of encroachment into the Leuser Ecosystem. To understand the landscape further, we have since commissioned independent mill assessments across Aceh Tamiang, Timur, and Singkil. Additionally, we closely engage our third-party suppliers, independent smallholders, and stakeholders in three priority areas: Tamiang, Timur, and Singkil.</p>
            <p>We have approximately 25 supplier mills located near the Leuser Ecosystem (Kawasan Ekosistem Leuser (KEL)). To address the gap between knowledge and action, we have developed tailored supplier engagement approaches from our experience. We reach out and assist our third-party suppliers, including the smallholders who supply to them and work towards sustainable production.</p>

            <h4>Supplier engagement</h4>
            <p>PT Pati Sari</p>
            <p>PT Pati Sari is located on the boundary of the Leuser ecosystem. In 2015, we worked with our supplier PT Pati Sari to better understand their supply base and procurement practices. We also ensured that they were complying with legal and operational requirements and conducted awareness and compliance training on our Sustainability Policy. Since 2018, we have engaged with independent smallholders supplying PT Pati Sari under our Extension Services Programme, which empowers our suppliers to engage their independent smallholders.</p>
            <h4>Independent smallholders</h4>
            <p>Extension Services Programme (ESP) to suppliers:</p>
            <p>PT Pati Sari</p>
            <p>As of September 2019, our team has provided training and support to 197 smallholders who supply to PT Pati Sari. The ESP curriculum includes improving market access, increasing yields through good agricultural practices, replanting efforts, and confirming the legality of their land titles.</p>
            <h4>External collaborations</h4>
            <p>We are integrating our project on PT Pati Sari and expanding our smallholder programs in Tamiang via a partnership with IDH (The Sustainable Trade Initiative), PepsiCo, Unilever, and other stakeholders, as both projects have overlapping focus areas. IDH has since signed a PPI (Production, Protection, Inclusion) Compact with the Government of Aceh Tamiang District, securing the government’s commitment to move Aceh Tamiang towards a sustainable commodity-producing region in Indonesia. Our collaboration with IDH also extends to Timur.</p>
            <p>Also, together with industry peers and partners, we fund the Areas for Priority Transformation (APT) program spearheaded by the Earthworm Foundation. The goal of this program is to reduce deforestation and demonstrate to the world the feasibility of balancing commodity production, conservation as well as good social and labor practices at scale. The program focuses on three mutually reinforcing areas of work: integrated land use planning with government, NDPE (No Deforestation, No Peat and No Exploitation) support and training for industry, and intensive capacity building for communities on the forest frontier. The APT program has managed to secure an MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) with PT Semadam to protect its remaining forest and an MoU with the local government. The APT program also focuses on Southern Aceh, which houses Rawa Singkil Wildlife Reserve, south of the Leuser Ecosystem (see section ‘Singkil’ below). More here.</p>

            <p>Riau is one of our top supplier provinces. We estimate that our supplier mills make up 70–80% of the total mills in the province, forming 23% of our total crude palm oil (CPO) procurement.</p>
            <p>Riau is the largest provincial contributor to the national production of palm oil and is the fifth-largest contributor towards Indonesia’s gross domestic product (GDP). Deforestation in the landscape has been severe. It has been estimated that illegal oil palm plantations have taken over at least 40% of the Tesso Nilo National Park. Another critical protected area is the Giam Siak Kecil peatlands, of which a significant portion is dominated by the pulp and paper sector. Riau is prone to forest fires during the annual dry season.</p>
            <p>Read our diagnostic report for Riau here.</p>
            <h4>Smallholder programs</h4>
            <p>As part of our independent smallholder program with IFC (International Finance Corporation), a member of the World Bank, we engaged smallholders supplying to our mills located in Riau. These mills are PT SAR (Sinar Agro Raya), PT BANI (Bahana Nusa Interindo), and PT ISB (Indomakmur Sawit Berjaya). More on this program here.</p>
            <p>Musim Mas is working with UNDP (United Nations Development Programme) to engage villages in Riau to establish smallholder programs.</p>
            <h4>External collaborations</h4>
            <p>Musim Mas is a member of the Tesso Nilo Taskforce since 2016. We are working with WWF Indonesia and Tesso Nilo National Park Foundation to mitigate human-elephant conflict around Tesso Nilo national park.</p>
            <p>We are also part of WWF Halt program, which helps supply chain stakeholders to register and digitally track FFB from plantation to mill. This traceability program would enable buyers (mills and traders) to identify and assess the legality of where the FFB originated, starting with a pilot around Tesso Nilo National Park.</p>
            <p>We are collaborating with an industry peer on a bottom-up, participatory landscape-level project to understand and map HCV-HCS areas, as well as existing and potential plots for smallholder expansion. We have finalized Siak district and PT. Teguh Karsa Wana Lestari (TKWL) as our mill for engagement, and have conducted in-depth analysis, training to build awareness with the mill staff, and assessments on the ground to identify potential HCS areas.</p>
            <p>Additionally, we are involved in a private-sector coalition, called the Siak-Pelalawan Landscape Program, which aims to support the government’s Siak Green District Initiative in its efforts to achieve sustainable palm oil production and align the delivery of sourcing commitments with the development goals of the district. These goals include protecting and enhancing forests, improving the livelihoods of smallholders and local communities, and establishing traceability data. Stakeholders involved include Cargill, Neste, PepsiCo, Golden AgriResources, Unilever, CORE, Sustainable District Platform (LTKL), Siak regent (local government).</p>
            <p>To improve the deforestation monitoring and verification system, we invested in the development of a new, publicly available radar-based forest monitoring system known as Radar Alerts for Detecting Deforestation (RADD). Siak-Pelalawan would be one of its pilot areas and it will be integrated into our landscape programs.</p>

            <p>Musi Banyuasin (MUBA) district has one of the highest numbers of supplier mills in our supply base. MUBA is the province’s second-largest district and its largest palm oil producer. Although deforestation in MUBA has been severe, there is still much remaining forest (160,000 hectares). This includes three protected areas covering 75,000 hectares that provide protection for important tiger habitats, including the Sembilang-Dangku landscape. MUBA offers a unique combination of supportive local government, numerous progressive companies, and multiple landscape initiatives that create a rare platform for change. The regency is the first to work towards RSPO Jurisdictional Certification.</p>
            <h4>Supplier engagement</h4>
            <p>We are implementing our Extension Services Program (ESP) for the independent smallholders in the supply chain of one of our suppliers’ mills, PT Bastian Olah Sawit (PT BOS), to assist them in improving their productivity through the implementation of good agricultural practices. PT BOS belongs to one of the supplier groups prioritized for engagement.</p>
            <p>We are also working with Daemeter, the Cadasta Foundation, and IT consultant GeoTraceability, to develop and implement a fully functioning Oil Palm Supply Chain Traceability System at one site in MUBA. The System will be a chain-of-custody mobile application that enables individual fresh fruit bunches (FFBs) to be tracked through the supply chain. This pilot project will cover the supply chain of PT BOS.</p>
            <h4>Smallholder programs</h4>
            <p>As mentioned above, we implemented an ESP program for our supplier PT BOS, assisting to train their smallholders on good agricultural practices. As of Sep 2019, 395 smallholders were engaged.</p>
            <p>In addition, we completed a project with Rainforest Alliance in 2019 to address sustainability issues relating to independent oil palm farmers in the region. The program also served to support the development of a jurisdictional approach for the entire regency. In the period of one year, 525 smallholders were engaged.</p>
            <h4>External collaborations
            <p>We intend to support a landscape program with IDH using the district government’s Green Growth Plan as a guide and develop a Smallholder Hub via the Centre of Excellence – a multi-stakeholder unit by LTKL (Sustainable Districts Association) and IDH aimed at sustainable development of a district. This includes training agriculture officers stationed in the district office or villages.</p>

            <p>West Kalimantan contributes 5% of our supply base and is one of the six provinces that contribute 80% of our supply base. We are able to trace up to 88% to plantation within the province, representing the highest percentage among the six provinces.</p>
            <h4>Supplier engagement</h4>
            <p>We have also conducted numerous mill verifications as part of our risk assessment on our suppliers. A diagnostic report on mill verifications conducted in Central Kalimantan aims to provide a clear roadmap on what it means to achieve sustainability transformation in concrete terms. The report provides input that helps us develop a strategic approach to address issues raised at the landscape level. Read the full report here.</p>
            <h4>Smallholder programs</h4>
            <p>We have established a smallholder program targeting smallholders supplying to our mill, PT Sarana Esa Cita.</p>
            <h4>External partnerships</h4>
            <p>We are working with Aidenvironment to explore the Sambas conservation project potentially in the areas of agroforestry. The program aims to balance forest conservation with economic development, by supporting local communities on social forestry knowledge and capacity by:</p>
